            Melissaâ€™s dream has always been to open up her own kennel where she
            can spend time with furry friends while treating them like her own!
            Melissa has worked at many different kennels in New York, California
            and Florida. She started her own business in 2016 doing pet sitting
            and dog walking after graduating from Bergin University of Canine
            Sciences. With the help of her loving family, she was finally able
            to achieve her dream and open up a kennel! With both indoor, and
            outdoor play areas, your dog will always be able to have fun! The
            knowledgeable staff will treat your dogs like family while they are
            here!
